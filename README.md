# Udacity data analyst project2 - Analyze AB test results
## by Imesha Kuruppu

### Introduction
A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists.
For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website.

### Project overview
The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Our goal is to work through this dataset to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision. Data was analyzed according to the probability, A/B tests, Regression and the final decision was made accordingly.
